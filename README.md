# File Line Counter

Counts the number of non-empty lines of a given file type.

## Usage
```bash
./script.sh <target-dir> <file-extension>
```

(If the file does not automatically come with executable permissions, you can update them with `chmod +x script.sh`.)

(Alternatively, you can run the file with `bash script.sh`.)

Personally, I:
 - Added executable permissions to the file (`chmod +x script.sh`).
 - changed the file name to "count-code" (`cp script.sh count-code`).
 - Moved the file to my path (`sudo mv count-code /usr/local/bin`)

Now I can check files from anywhere in the terminal, as seen in the examples below.

## Examples

```bash
blnote % count-code . go
# Output: 
# Reading ./note/note.go...
# Reading ./cmd/cmd.go...
# Reading ./utils/utils.go...
# Reading ./node/node.go...
# Reading ./main.go...
# Finished reading go files!
# Total number of lines with text in *.go files: 247
```

```bash
blfmt % count-code src rs
# Output:
# Reading src/format.rs...
# Reading src/options.rs...
# Reading src/main.rs...
# Reading src/group.rs...
# Reading src/parser.rs...
# Reading src/utils.rs...
# Finished reading rs files!
# Total number of lines with text in *.rs files: 820
```

Be careful though, because it will count everything, whether you want it to or not...

```bash
blfmt % count-code planning py
# Output:
# (There were several hundreds of lines above these ones as well...)
# Reading planning/env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/_vendor/platformdirs/windows.py...
# Reading planning/env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/_vendor/platformdirs/__main__.py...
# Reading planning/env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/__init__.py...
# Reading planning/env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/__pip-runner__.py...
# Reading planning/env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/__main__.py...
# Reading planning/utils.py...
# Reading planning/my_format.py...
# Reading planning/group.py...
# Reading planning/script.py...
# Finished reading py files!
# Total number of lines with text in *.py files: 354565
```
